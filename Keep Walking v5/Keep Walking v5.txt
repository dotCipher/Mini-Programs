/*  This is an advanced program that follows a mathamatical pattern 
like algorithm that is used for finding out the answer to a formula 
of recursion.  It goes as follows:
A = n1^2 + 1 + 3
B = n2^2 + A + 3
C = n3^2 + B + 3
D = n4^2 + C + 3
etc...

An example of this is
5 = 1 * 1 + 1 + 3
12 = 2 * 2 + 5 + 3
24 = 3 * 3 + 12 + 3
43 = 4 * 4 + 24 + 3
71 = 5 * 5 + 43 + 3
